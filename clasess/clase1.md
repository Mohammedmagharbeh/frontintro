n first meeting we learned how install (github desktop,vs code)..We talked about git, which has an important benefit, which is storing the code to facilitate returning to it and modifying it easily.
And we talked about live server  and his most
important function which allows us to open any browser by typing its name such as (google.com,
facebook.com...).
In second meeting we will learn what 
 is the HTML language,and how to use it.
